# Manifests

[cluster](./cluster) contains the kustomization templates and the manifests generated by the kustomization templates,
which can be used to deploy the Harbor operator with the related dependent operators (psql, redis and minIO) and
then provide the capabilities of deploying Harbor cluster.

[harbor](./harbor) contains the kustomization templates and the manifests generated by the kustomization templates,
which can be used to deploy only the Harbor operator.

[samples](./samples) contains the manifest yaml files for deploying sample Harbor.
